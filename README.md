# About me :)

I'm currently a Master's research student at the Computer Science Department of IIT Tirupati, India where I'm exploring the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and software engineering. Prior to my academic pursuits, I accumulated 3.3 years of enriching experience as a software engineer in industry. 


## Academic Pursuits

As a Master's research student, my focus lies at customised FedLLM (Federated Large Language Model). Specifically, I'm passionate about leveraging training, fine-tuning, inference techniques in NLP to solve real-world problems in software engineering and beyond. My research interests encompass neural network models, language models, and open-source large language models (LLMs) for a wide array of NLP tasks.

## Industry Experience

With over three years of experience in the software industry, I've had the privilege of working on Anti-Money Laundering and Risk Finance Technology projects that have gifted my skills in data analytics, model development, software maintenance, problem-solving, and collaboration. The experience from the industry inspired me to work on Software Engineering research, and the academia gave me oppurtunities to fulfill it. 

## Recent Software Engineering Papers

Here are some of my recent contributions to the software engineering domain:

- ["Code Summarization without Direct Access to Code - Towards Exploring Federated LLMs for Software Engineering" (EASE-2024)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3661167.3661210): In this study, we train LLama open source LLM (Large Language Model) using Federated Learning. Federated Learning is a technique in which few clients exchange their model weights to build a shared model, this is preferred as it retains the privacy of the clients (they don't share their data directly, but instead share their learnt knowledge interms of model weight).
- ["On the Need for Empirically Investigating Fast-Growing Programming Languages" (ICSE-Proceedings-2024)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3639478.3643524): The short paper throws some light on the need for empirically investigating fast-growing languages as the title suggests. 
- [“What Do Developers Feel About Fast-Growing Programming Languages? An Exploratory Study“ (ICPC-2024)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3643916.3644422): The study identifies the primary emotion of developers while working with top fast-growing languages using Distill-RoBERTa model. The study offers a GitHub comment analysis, and cross-validates it with developer survey.
