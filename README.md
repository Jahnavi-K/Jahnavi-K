# About Me :)

I'm a Master's research student at IIT Tirupati's Computer Science Department, focusing on the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and software engineering. Before this, I spent over three years as a software engineer, working on Anti-Money Laundering and Risk Finance Technology, which honed my skills in data analytics and model development. This industry experience inspired my current academic focus on Federated Large Language Models (FedLLM), particularly in training, fine-tuning, and applying these models to real-world software engineering problems.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about exploring neural network models, language models, and open-source LLMs, applying them across various NLP tasks. My primary project involves training the LLama model using Federated Learning to ensure privacy while sharing learned knowledge through model weights.
